Problem Statement 1:
Consider the dataset provided below. The dataset has the following contents: Risk (measured in units), Age (measured in years), Blood Pressure (measured in blood pressure units).
There’s a discussion going on within your council regarding the risk of a stroke affected by the age and blood pressure.
Is it true that the (average) blood pressure for smokers is higher than it is for non-smokers?
Questions #A - #F
For smokers only:
• By how much does the risk increase if age increases by ten years?
• By how much does the risk increase if blood pressure increases by 10 units?
• By how much does risk increase if blood pressure increases by 10%?
For non-smokers only:
• By how much does the risk increase if age increases by ten years?
• By how much does the risk increase if blood pressure increases by 10 units?
• By how much does risk increase if blood pressure increases by 10%?

Problem Statement 2:
Prepare a strategy, such that feeding the value of significant parameter(s) (age, risk factor and blood pressure) estimates the odds that the person is a smoker and yields the output within a CSV file.
Check the CSV output for a risk value of 12
